In this section, we discuss the essential requirements related to machine learning infrastructure. Make sure to review and set up your environment accordingly before diving into your ML project.

## Key Challenges in Deployment

Understanding the challenges in deploying machine learning models is crucial. This section addresses two significant challenges:

- Concept Drift
- Data Drift

### Metrics to Monitor

Monitoring is key to successful deployment. We focus on various metrics, including:

- Software Metrics
- Input Metrics
- Output Metrics

### How Quickly Do They Change?

It's essential to know the pace of metric changes, as user data and enterprise data may vary. Stay informed to adapt your models accordingly.

### Why Model Drifts?

Explore the reasons behind model drift, including data drift, concept drift, or a combination of both. Recognizing these factors is the first step in addressing model performance issues.

## Data Drift

Data drift involves changes in input data, such as shifts in the distribution of variables. Learn how to identify and mitigate data drift to keep your model relevant.

## Concept Drift

Concept drift occurs when the relationships between model inputs and outputs change over time. Understand the nuances of concept drift and its impact on model performance.

## Dealing with Drift

When faced with drift, take proactive measures to maintain model accuracy:

- Retrain the model using all available data.
- Assign higher weights to new data to prioritize recent patterns.
- Consider dropping past data if sufficient new data is available.

## Recurring Concept Drift

Teach your model to adapt to seasonality and recurring patterns, ensuring its effectiveness over time.
